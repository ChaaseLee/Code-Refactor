# Code Refactor Project

## Description

I refactored the code on the index.html by:

- Changing "div" elements into semantic elements.
- 

Refactored the CSS selectors in style-sheet by:

- Organizing the selectors to match the logical structure og the html elements.
- Changed the name of selectors to correctly match the semantic elements that were added to index.html
